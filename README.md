# Milap

**Connect. Collaborate. Create.**

Milap is where builders find their tribe. I built this platform to solve a problem I kept facing: finding the right people to collaborate with on projects. Too many platforms are just noise - Milap cuts through that to create meaningful connections.


## What Makes Milap Different

Unlike typical social platforms, Milap focuses on:

- **Real connections** - Match with people building similar things
- **No noise** - Direct communication without the endless scrolling
- **Project-first approach** - Your work is your introduction

You can chat in real-time, showcase what you're building, and find collaborators who share your vision.

## Built With

- React + TypeScript
- Firebase Realtime DB for instant messaging
- TailwindCSS for the clean UI
- Framer Motion for those smooth transitions

## Getting Started

Want to run Milap locally? Here's how:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Sidopolis/milap.git
cd milap

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

You'll need to set up your own Firebase config. Create a `.env` file with:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-key-here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-domain
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your-db-url
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

## Roadmap

I'm working on some exciting features:

- Project matching algorithm improvements
- Video chat integration
- Portfolio showcases
- Community challenges

## Join the Community

This is just the beginning. If you're a builder looking to connect with other makers, check out [Milap](https://milap-platform.vercel.app) and start finding your people.
